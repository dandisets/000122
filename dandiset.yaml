description: This experiment examines how the motor cortex is activated during a finger-tapping
  task. Participants are asked to either tap their left thumb to fingers, tap their
  right thumb to fingers, or no cue is given (control). Tapping lasts for 5 seconds
  and is prompted by an auditory cue. Sensors are placed over the motor cortex as
  described in the montage section in the link below, short channels are attached
  to the scalp too. Further details about the experiment (including presentation code)
  can be found at https://github.com/rob-luke/experiment-fNIRS-tapping.
